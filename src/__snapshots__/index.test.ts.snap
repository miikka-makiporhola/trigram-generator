What may not be expected in a country of eternal light? I may there discover the wondrous power which attracts the needle and may regulate a thousand celestial observations that require only this voyage to render their seeming eccentricities consistent for ever visible, its broad disk just skirting the horizon and diffusing a perpetual splendour. There, Margaret, the sun is for ever. I arrived here yesterday, and my first task is to assure my dear sister of my welfare and increasing confidence in the success of my undertaking. I am already far north of London, and as I walk in the streets of Petersburgh, Dec. 11 th, 17—. You will rejoice to hear that no disaster has accompanied the commencement of an enterprise which you have regarded with such evil forebodings. I try in vain to be persuaded that the pole is the seat of frost and desolation; it ever presents itself to my imagination as the region of beauty and delight. Do you understand this feeling? This breeze, which braces my nerves and fills me with delight. There— for with your leave, my daydreams become more fervent and vivid. I shall satiate my ardent curiosity with the joy a child feels when he embarks in a little boat, with his holiday mates, on an expedition of discovery up his native river. But supposing all these conjectures to be false, you cannot contest the inestimable benefit which I am advancing, gives me a foretaste of those icy climes. Inspirited by this wind of promise, my sister, I feel a cold northern breeze play upon my cheeks, which has travelled from the regions towards which I shall confer on all mankind, to the last generation, by discovering a passage near the pole to those countries, to reach which at present so many months are requisite; or by ascertaining the secret of the world never before visited, and may tread a land surpassing in wonders and in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the habitable globe. Its productions and features may be wafted to a land never before imprinted by the foot of man. These are my enticements, and they are sufficient to conquer all fear of danger or death and to induce me to heaven, for nothing contributes so much to tranquillise the mind as a steady purpose— a point on which the soul may fix its intellectual eye. This expedition has been the favourite dream of my early years. I have read with ardour the accounts of the magnet, which, if at all possible, can only be effected by an undertaking such as mine. These reflections have dispelled the agitation with which I began my letter, and I feel my heart glow with an enthusiasm which stimulated my intended labours. I also became a poet and for one year lived in a seafaring life. These volumes were my study day and night, and my familiarity with them increased that regret which I had felt, as the phenomena of the various voyages which have been made in the prospect of arriving at the North Pacific Ocean through the seas which surround the pole. You may remember that a history of all the voyages made for purposes of discovery composed the whole of our good Uncle Thomas’ library. My education was neglected, yet I was passionately fond of reading. These visions faded when I perused, for the first time, those poets whose effusions entranced my soul and lifted it to heaven. I can, even now, remember the hour from which I dedicated myself to this great enterprise. I commenced by inuring my body to hardship. I accompanied the whale-fishers on several expeditions to the North Sea; I imagined that I also might obtain a niche in the temple where the names of Homer and Shakespeare are consecrated. You are well acquainted with my failure and how heavily I bore the disappointment. But just at that time I inherited the fortune of my own creation; I voluntarily endured cold, famine, thirst, and my thoughts were turned into the channel of their earlier bent. Six years have passed since I resolved on my present undertaking. I must own I felt a little proud when my captain offered me the second dignity in the vessel and entreated me to embark in a paradise of my cousin, and want of sleep; I often worked harder than the common sailors during the day and devoted my nights to the study of mathematics, the theory of medicine, and those branches of physical science from which a naval adventurer might derive the greatest practical advantage. Twice I actually hired myself as an under-mate in a Greenland whaler, and acquitted myself to admiration. I am about to proceed on a long and difficult voyage, the emergencies of which will demand all my fortitude: I am required not only to raise the spirits of others, but I preferred glory to every enticement that wealth placed in my path. Oh, that some encouraging voice would answer in the affirmative! My courage and my resolution is firm; but my hopes fluctuate, and my spirits are often depressed. I have already adopted, for there is a great difference between walking the deck and remaining seated motionless for hours, when theirs are failing. This is the most favourable period for travelling in Russia. They fly quickly over the snow in their sledges; the motion is pleasant, and, sailing over a calm sea, we may be without example, as a child, on learning that my father’ s dying injunction had forbidden my uncle to allow me to remain with the greatest earnestness, so valuable did he consider my services. And now, dear Margaret, do I not deserve to accomplish some great purpose? My life might have been passed in ease and luxury, but sometimes to sustain my own, when no exercise prevents the blood from actually freezing in your veins. I shall depart for the latter town in a fortnight or three weeks; and, in my opinion, far more agreeable than that of an English stagecoach. The cold is not excessive, if you are wrapped in furs— a dress which I have no ambition to lose my life on the post-road between St. Petersburgh, I will put some trust in preceding navigators— there snow and frost are banished; and my intention is to hire a ship there, which can easily be done by paying the insurance for the owner, and to engage as many sailors as I think necessary among those who are accustomed to the whale-fishing. I do not intend to sail until the month of June; and when shall I return? Ah, dear sister, how can I answer this question? If I succeed, many, many months, perhaps years, will pass before you and I may meet. If I fail, you will see me again soon, or never. Farewell, my dear, excellent Margaret. Heaven shower down blessings on you, and save me, that I may again and again testify my gratitude for all your love and kindness. Your affectionate brother, R. Walton Letter 2_ To Mrs. Saville, England._ St. Petersburgh and Archangel. I have hired a vessel and am occupied in collecting my sailors; those whom I have already engaged appear to be men on whom I can depend and are certainly possessed of dauntless courage. But I have one want which I have never yet been able to satisfy, and the absence of the object of which I now feel as a most severe evil, I have no friend, Margaret: when I am by frost and snow! Yet a second step is taken towards my enterprise. I shall commit my thoughts to paper, it is true; but that is a poor medium for the communication of feeling. I desire the company of a man who could sympathise with me, whose eyes would reply to mine. You may deem me romantic, my dear sister, but I bitterly feel the want of a friend. I have no one will endeavour to sustain me in dejection. I first became acquainted with the enthusiasm of success, there will be none to participate my joy; if I am glowing with the celebrated poets of our own country; but it was only when it had ceased to be in my power to derive its most important benefits from such a friend repair the faults of your poor brother! I am assailed by disappointment, no one near me, gentle yet courageous, possessed of a cultivated as well as of a capacious mind, whose tastes are like my own, to approve or amend my plans. How slowly the time passes here, encompassed as I am too ardent in execution and too impatient of difficulties. But it is a still greater evil to me that I am self-educated: for the first fourteen years of my life I ran wild on a common and read nothing but our Uncle Thomas’ books of voyages. At that age I became acquainted with more languages than that of my native country. Now I am twenty-eight and am in reality more illiterate than many schoolboys of fifteen. It is true that I perceived the necessity of becoming acquainted with him on board a whale vessel; finding that he was unemployed in this city, I easily engaged him to assist in my enterprise. The master is a man of wonderful courage and enterprise; he is madly desirous of glory, or rather, to word my phrase more characteristically, of advancement in his profession. He is an Englishman, and affection enough for me to endeavour to regulate my mind. Well, these are useless complaints; I shall certainly find no friend on the wide ocean, nor even here in Archangel, 28 th March, 17—. How would such a conviction that I have thought more and that my daydreams are more extended and magnificent, but they want( as the painters call it)_ keeping;_ and I greatly need a friend who would have sense enough not to despise me as romantic, and in the midst of national and professional prejudices, unsoftened by cultivation, retains some of the noblest endowments of humanity. I heard of a mariner equally noted for his gentleness and the mildness of his discipline. This circumstance, added to his well-known integrity and dauntless courage, made me very desirous to engage him. A youth passed in solitude, my best years spent under your gentle and feminine fosterage, has so refined the groundwork of my character that I cannot overcome an intense distaste to the dross of human nature, beat even in these rugged bosoms. My lieutenant, for instance, is a person of an excellent disposition and is remarkable in the ship for his kindliness of heart and the respect and obedience paid to him by his crew, I felt myself peculiarly fortunate in being able to secure his services. I shall do nothing rashly: you know me sufficiently to confide in my resolutions. Those are as fixed as fate, and when I heard of him first in rather a romantic manner, from a lady who owes to him the happiness of her life. This, briefly, is his story. Some years ago he loved a young Russian lady of moderate fortune, and having amassed a considerable sum in prize-money, the father of the girl consented to the usual brutality exercised on board ship: I have never believed it to be necessary, and throwing herself at his feet, entreated him to spare her, confessing at the same time that she loved another, but that he was poor, and that her father would never consent to the match. He saw his mistress once before the destined ceremony; but she was bathed in tears, and on being informed of the name of her lover, instantly abandoned his pursuit. He had already bought a farm with his money, on which he had designed to pass the remainder of his life; but he bestowed the whole on his rival, together with the remains of his prize-money to purchase stock, and then himself solicited the young woman’ s father to consent to her marriage with her lover. But the old man decidedly refused, thinking himself bound in honour to my friend, who, when he found the father inexorable, quitted his country, nor returned until he heard that his former mistress was married according to her inclinations.“ What a noble fellow!” you will exclaim. He is so; but then he is wholly uneducated: he is as silent as a Turk, and a kind of ignorant carelessness attends him, which, while it renders his conduct the more astonishing, detracts from the interest and sympathy which otherwise he would command. Yet some feelings, unallied to the union. My generous friend reassured the suppliant, and my voyage is only now delayed until the weather shall permit my embarkation. The winter has been dreadfully severe, but the spring promises well, and it is considered as a remarkably early season, so that perhaps I may never know, that I am wavering in my prudence and considerateness whenever the safety of others is committed to my care. I cannot describe to you my sensations on the near prospect of my undertaking. It is impossible to communicate to you a conception of the trembling sensation, half pleasurable and half fearful, with which I may sail sooner than I expected. I am preparing to depart. I have often attributed my attachment to, my passionate enthusiasm for, the dangerous mysteries of ocean to that production of the most imaginative of modern poets. There is something at work in my soul which I am going to unexplored regions, to“ the land of mist and snow,” but I shall kill no albatross; therefore do not suppose, because I complain a little or because I can conceive a consolation for my toils which I do not be alarmed for my safety or if I should come back to you as worn and woeful as the“ Ancient Mariner.” You will smile at my allusion, but I will disclose a secret. I am practically industrious— painstaking, a workman to execute with perseverance and labour— but besides this there is a love for the marvellous, a belief in the marvellous, intertwined in all my projects, which hurries me out of the common pathways of men, even to the wild sea and unvisited regions I am about to explore. But to return to dearer considerations. Shall I meet you again, after having traversed immense seas, and returned by the most southern cape of Africa or America? I dare not expect such success, yet I cannot bear to look on the reverse of the picture. Continue for the present to write to me by every opportunity: I may receive your letters on some occasions when I need them most to support my spirits. I love you very tenderly. Remember me with affection, should you never hear from me again. Your affectionate brother, Robert Walton Letter 3_ To Mrs. Saville, England._ Archangel, among merchants and seamen. Yet do not understand. I am safe— and well advanced on my voyage. This letter will reach England by a merchantman now on its homeward voyage from Archangel; more fortunate than I, who may not see my native land, perhaps, for many years. I will not rashly encounter danger. I profited of this time to rest for a few lines in haste to say that I am, however, in good spirits: my men are bold and apparently firm of purpose, nor do the floating sheets of ice that continually pass us, indicating the dangers of the region towards which we are advancing, appear to dismay them. We have already reached a very high latitude; but it is the height of summer, and although not so warm as in England, the southern gales, which blow us speedily towards those shores which I so ardently desire to attain, breathe a degree of renovating warmth which I had not expected. No incidents have hitherto befallen us that would make a figure in a letter. One or two stiff gales and the springing of a leak are accidents which experienced navigators scarcely remember to record, and I shall be well content if nothing worse happen to us during our voyage. Adieu, my dear Margaret. Be assured that for my own sake, as well as yours, I write a few hours. In the morning, fearing to encounter in the ship on all sides, scarcely leaving her the sea-room in which she floated. Our situation was somewhat dangerous, especially as we were nearly surrounded by ice, which closed in the atmosphere and weather. About two o’ clock the mist cleared away, and prudent. But success_ shall_ crown my endeavours. Wherefore not? Thus far I have gone, tracing a secure way over the pathless seas, the very stars themselves being witnesses and testimonies of my triumph. Why not still proceed over the untamed yet obedient element? What can stop the determined heart and resolved will of man? My swelling heart involuntarily pours itself out thus. But I must finish. Heaven bless my beloved sister! R. W. Letter 4_ To Mrs. Saville, England._ July 7 th, 17—. My dear Sister, I will be cool, persevering, and we beheld, stretched out in every direction, vast and irregular plains of ice, which seemed to have no end. Some of my comrades groaned, and my own mind began to grow watchful with anxious thoughts, when a strange sight suddenly attracted our attention and diverted our solicitude from our own situation. We accordingly lay to, hoping that some change would take place in the sledge and drawn by dogs, pass on towards the north, at the distance of half a mile; a being which had the shape of a man, but apparently of gigantic stature, sat in the dark those large loose masses which float about after the breaking up of the traveller with our telescopes until he was lost among the distant inequalities of the ice. This appearance excited our unqualified wonder. We perceived a low carriage, fixed on a sledge and guided the dogs. We watched the rapid progress of the ice broke and freed our ship. We were, as we believed, many hundred miles from any land; but this apparition seemed to denote that it was not, in reality, so distant as we had supposed. Shut in, however, by ice, it was impossible to follow his track, which we had observed with the greatest attention. About two hours after this occurrence we heard the ground sea, and before night the ice. I replied, however, lay to until the morning, however, as soon as it was light, I went upon deck and found all the sailors busy on one side of the vessel, apparently talking to someone in the sea. It was, in fact, a sledge, like that we had seen before, which had drifted towards us in the night on a large fragment of ice. Only one dog remained alive; but there was a human being within it whom the sailors were persuading to enter the vessel. He was not, as the other traveller seemed to be, a savage inhabitant of some undiscovered island, but a European. When I appeared on deck the master said,“ Here is our captain, and he will not allow you to perish on the open sea.” On perceiving me, the stranger addressed me in English, although it is very probable that you will see me before these papers can come into your possession. Last Monday( July 31 st) we were compassed round by a very thick fog. We, however, that we were on a voyage of discovery towards the northern pole. Upon hearing this he appeared satisfied and consented to come on board your vessel,” said he,“ will you have the kindness to inform me whither you are bound?” You may conceive my astonishment on hearing such a question addressed to me from a man on the brink of destruction and to whom I should have supposed that my vessel would have been a resource which he would not have exchanged for the most precious wealth the earth can afford. I never saw a man in so wretched a condition. We attempted to carry him into the cabin, but as soon as he had quitted the fresh air he fainted. We accordingly brought him back to the deck and restored him to animation by rubbing him with brandy and forcing him to swallow a small quantity. As soon as he showed signs of life we wrapped him up in blankets and placed him near the chimney of the kitchen stove. By slow degrees he recovered and ate a little soup, which restored him wonderfully. Two days passed in this manner before he was able to speak, and his body dreadfully emaciated by fatigue and suffering. I never saw a more interesting creature: his eyes have generally an expression of wildness, and I often feared that his sufferings had deprived him of understanding. When he had in some measure recovered, I removed him to my own cabin and attended on him as much as my duty would permit. I replied that I cannot forbear recording it, although with a foreign accent.“ Before I come on board. Good God! Margaret, if you had seen the man who thus capitulated for his safety, your surprise would have been boundless. His limbs were nearly frozen, and even madness, but there are moments when, if anyone performs an act of kindness towards him or does him any the most trifling service, his whole countenance is lighted up, as it were, with a beam of benevolence and sweetness that I never saw equalled. But he is generally melancholy and despairing, and sometimes he gnashes his teeth, as if impatient of the weight of woes that oppresses him. When my guest was a little recovered I had great trouble to keep off the men, who wished to ask him a thousand questions; but I would not allow him to be tormented by their idle curiosity, in a state of body and mind whose restoration evidently depended upon entire repose. Once, however, the lieutenant asked why he had come so far upon the ice in so strange a vehicle. His countenance instantly assumed an aspect of the deepest gloom, and he replied,“ To seek one who fled from me.”“ And did the man whom you pursued travel in the same fashion?”“ Yes.”“ Then I fancy we have seen him, for the day before we picked you up we saw some dogs drawing a sledge, with a man in it, across the ice.” This aroused the stranger’ s attention, and he asked a multitude of questions concerning the route which the dæmon, as he called him, had pursued. Soon after, when he was alone with me, he said,“ I have, doubtless, excited your curiosity, as well as that of these good people; but you are too considerate to make inquiries.”“ Certainly; it would indeed be very impertinent and inhuman in me to trouble you with any inquisitiveness of mine.”“ And yet you rescued me from a strange and perilous situation; you have benevolently restored me to life.” Soon after this he inquired if I thought that the breaking up of the ice had destroyed the other sledge. I have persuaded him to remain in the cabin, for the ice had not broken until near midnight, and the traveller might have arrived at a place of safety before that time; but of this I could not answer with any degree of certainty, for he is far too weak to sustain the rawness of the stranger. He manifested the greatest eagerness to be upon deck to watch for the sledge which had before appeared; but I have promised that someone should watch for him and give him instant notice if any new object should appear in sight. Such is my journal of what relates to this strange occurrence up to the present day. The stranger has gradually improved in health but is very silent and appears uneasy when anyone except myself enters his cabin. Yet his manners are so conciliating and gentle that the sailors are all interested in him, although they have had very little communication with him. For my own part, I begin to love him as a brother, and his constant and deep grief fills me with sympathy and compassion. He must have been a noble creature in his better days, being even now in wreck so attractive and amiable. I said in one of my letters, my dear Margaret, that I could not judge. From this time a new spirit of life animated the decaying frame of the atmosphere. I shall continue my journal concerning the stranger at intervals, should I have found a man who, before his spirit had been broken by misery, I should find no friend on the wide ocean; yet I have any fresh incidents to record. August 13 th, 17—. So strange an accident has happened to us that I should have been happy to have possessed as the brother of my heart. I was easily led by the sympathy which he evinced to use the language of my eventual success and into every minute detail of the measures I had taken to secure it. I paused; at length he spoke, a dark gloom spread over my listener’ s life or death were but a small price to pay for the sledge that preceded his own. Yet, although his words are culled with the choicest art, yet so wise; his mind is so gentle, yet they flow with rapidity and unparalleled eloquence. He excites at once my admiration and my pity to an astonishing degree. How can I see so noble a creature destroyed by misery without feeling the most poignant grief? He is so cultivated, and when he speaks, although unhappy, he is not so utterly occupied by his own misery but that he interests himself deeply in the projects of others. He is now much recovered from his illness and is continually on the deck, apparently watching for the acquirement of the knowledge which I have communicated to him without disguise. He has frequently conversed with me on mine, which I sought, for the dominion I should acquire and transmit over the elemental foes"`;
